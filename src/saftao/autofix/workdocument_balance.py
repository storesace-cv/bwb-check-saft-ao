    """Return ``text`` ensuring ``WorkDocument`` tags are properly balanced.

    The routine walks through the ``WorkDocument`` opening and closing tags
    maintaining a stack with the indentation detected for each opening tag.
    When a duplicate closing tag is found (i.e. without a corresponding
    opening tag on the stack) it is removed.  Conversely, when a new opening
    tag is encountered while a previous one is still open, a closing tag is
    injected before continuing.  Any remaining open tags at the end of the
    traversal are closed in the order they were opened.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text:
        The original XML text.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[str, bool]
        The potentially modified XML text and a boolean indicating whether
        modifications were applied.
